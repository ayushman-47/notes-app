## 🌐 Language Handling:
- The user will **select the output language (English or Hindi)** from a dropdown in the dashboard.  
- Always generate the notes in the chosen language while keeping the same structure and depth.

## 🎯 Input Options:
The app dashboard will provide two ways to generate notes:
1. **Chapter Name Input** → User selects Class → Subject → enters Chapter Name.  
   - The system should fetch/analyze the official NCERT PDF text for that chapter.  
2. **Direct PDF Upload** → User uploads an NCERT chapter PDF.  
   - The system should analyze the uploaded PDF and generate Diamond Notes.

## 🎯 Class–Subject–Chapter Logic:

1. Class (1–12)  
2. Subject (options change dynamically based on class/stream)  
3. Chapter Name (only if not uploading PDF)  
4. Output Language (English or Hindi)  

### ✅ Subject Mapping:
- **Classes 1–8** → Mathematics, English, Hindi, Bengali, Science, Social Science  
- **Classes 9–10** → Mathematics, English, Hindi, Bengali, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, Political Science, Economics  
- **Classes 11–12**  
  - **Arts/Humanities** → History, Geography, Political Science, Economics, Sociology, Philosophy, Psychology, Social Science  
  - **Commerce** → Economics, Business Studies, Accountancy, Mathematics  
  - **Science** → Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology

## 🔎 Task for the AI:
When the user provides input, the system should:  
1. If **chapter name is given**, fetch the NCERT chapter text/PDF and generate Diamond Notes.  
2. If **PDF is uploaded**, analyze the PDF directly and generate Diamond Notes.  
3. Format output in the **Diamond Notes structure**.  
4. Use the **selected output language (English or Hindi)**.
